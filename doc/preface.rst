About this tutorial
-------------------

This document is a summary of my valueable experiences in using Python decumentation ``Sphinx`` with ``Github`` webpage. The PDF version can be downloaded from `HERE <sphinxgithub.pdf>`_. **You may download and distribute it. Please be aware, however, that the note contains typos as well as inaccurate or incorrect description.** 

In this repository, I try to use the detailed demo code and 
examples to show how to use ``Sphinx`` to generate the ``.html`` and ``.pdf`` documents and how to hookup them automatically on ``Github``. If you find your work wasn’t cited in this note, please feel free to let me know.

Although I am by no means a python programming and Sphinx expert, 
I decided that it would be useful for me to share what I learned 
about Sphinx in the form of easy tutorials with detailed example. 
I hope those tutorials will be a valuable tool for your studies.

The tutorials assume that the reader has a preliminary knowledge of ``python`` programing, ``LaTex`` and ``Linux``. And this document is generated automatically by using `sphinx`_.

Motivation for this tutorial 
++++++++++++++++++++++++++++
``Sphinx`` is an awesome Python documentation package, and it has excellent facilities for the documentation of software projects in a range of languages. I have been using ``Sphinx`` for almost 4 years. I was impressed and attracted by Sphinx in the first using. And I foud that:

* It supports **several popular output formats**: ``HTML`` (including Windows HTML Help), ``LaTeX`` (for printable PDF versions), ePub, Texinfo, manual pages, plain text.

* It has **easy publishing routes**: Github.

* Is has **extensive cross-references**: semantic markup and automatic links for functions, classes, citations, glossary terms and similar pieces of information

* It has **hierarchical structure**: easy definition of a document tree, with automatic links to siblings, parents and children.

* It has **automatic indices**: general index as well as a language-specific module indices

* It has awesome **code handling**: automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter

* Is has abundant **extensions**: automatic testing of code snippets, inclusion of docstrings from Python modules (API docs), and more

* It has abundant **contributed extensions**: more than 50 extensions contributed by users in a second repository; most of them installable from PyPI
