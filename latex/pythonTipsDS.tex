\subsection{About this tutorial}
\label{\detokenize{preface:about-this-tutorial}}
This document is a summary of my valueable experiences in using Python decumentation \sphinxcode{Sphinx} with \sphinxcode{Github} webpage. The PDF version can be downloaded from \sphinxhref{sphinxgithub.pdf}{HERE}. \sphinxstylestrong{You may download and distribute it. Please be aware, however, that the note contains typos as well as inaccurate or incorrect description.}

In this repository, I try to use the detailed demo code and
examples to show how to use \sphinxcode{Sphinx} to generate the \sphinxcode{.html} and \sphinxcode{.pdf} documents and how to hookup them automatically on \sphinxcode{Github}. If you find your work wasn’t cited in this note, please feel free to let me know.

Although I am by no means a python programming and Sphinx expert,
I decided that it would be useful for me to share what I learned
about Sphinx in the form of easy tutorials with detailed example.
I hope those tutorials will be a valuable tool for your studies.

The tutorials assume that the reader has a preliminary knowledge of \sphinxcode{python} programing, \sphinxcode{LaTex} and \sphinxcode{Linux}. And this document is generated automatically by using \sphinxhref{http://sphinx.pocoo.org}{sphinx}.

\section{Motivation for this tutorial}
\label{\detokenize{preface:motivation-for-this-tutorial}}
\sphinxcode{Sphinx} is an awesome Python documentation package, and it has excellent facilities for the documentation of software projects in a range of languages. I have been using \sphinxcode{Sphinx} for almost 4 years. I was impressed and attracted by Sphinx in the first using. And I foud that:
\begin{itemize}
\item {} 
It supports \sphinxstylestrong{several popular output formats}: \sphinxcode{HTML} (including Windows HTML Help), \sphinxcode{LaTeX} (for printable PDF versions), ePub, Texinfo, manual pages, plain text.

\item {} 
It has \sphinxstylestrong{easy publishing routes}: Github.

\item {} 
Is has \sphinxstylestrong{extensive cross-references}: semantic markup and automatic links for functions, classes, citations, glossary terms and similar pieces of information

\item {} 
It has \sphinxstylestrong{hierarchical structure}: easy definition of a document tree, with automatic links to siblings, parents and children.

\item {} 
It has \sphinxstylestrong{automatic indices}: general index as well as a language-specific module indices

\item {} 
It has awesome \sphinxstylestrong{code handling}: automatic highlighting using the Pygments highlighter

\item {} 
Is has abundant \sphinxstylestrong{extensions}: automatic testing of code snippets, inclusion of docstrings from Python modules (API docs), and more

\item {} 
It has abundant \sphinxstylestrong{contributed extensions}: more than 50 extensions contributed by users in a second repository; most of them installable from PyPI

\end{itemize}


\section{Feedback and suggestions}
